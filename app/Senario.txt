import { userAgent } from "next/server"

1- receive : {
    {wallet_address:9amABYwZ73MtduGjWD3Ne3LUyf9PgCeK7nrnALX3KQM1,call_back:macrobo2.com,order_id:4004:amount:4000}
}

2- send it to solana blockchain and store it and recive trancsaction code
(in first of work we can for this step only use dev solana network to store data for avoiding from Fee
 until we have a plan to earn SOL from community by donating or charge plan or recice fee from second step(final user))
 
 OR  ==> (-- encrypt it AES algoritm

        -- Store it in database)



4 - return transaction code or mongo_id to userAgent

5 - user redirect to link by id => solana transaction code or mongo_id

6 - retrive data from solana network ot mongodb and decrypt and finaly go to payment. (Also store order_id and client website as meme data)

7- return to callback address
